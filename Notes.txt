How to get app running on host
- AWS looks better that WebFaction, Azure, Heroku, Google Cloud.
- Failed to get my app deployed.
- Start over completely, create new environment, follow their exact doc.
Take notes as I go about every step, so I can reproduce success or describe failure.




Now we have a basic client/server framework with CRUD and user logon with token and server stores hashed passwords.
Next:
    - Put framwork into git, learn how to use it.
    - Using framework, setup deployment, with dev, staging, and production. Test.
    - Announce on node meetup that I have a node/express/sequelize framework w tokens, hashed pwds.

One step at a time add framwork to prototype and refactor prototype:
    - Put the entire prototype into the public folder. It replaces index.html. Make that index2.html.
    - Get logon working. This is the first big step. The rest will be easy but take time.
    - Admin page, add three sections for countries, orgs, users.
    - Get countries working.
    - Get orgs working.
    - Get users working, with lots of validation.
    - Refactor how three TrsDatabase tables are done into dataModel and viewModel.
    - Put these three tables into the database.
    - Redo the local storage articles table, put into database.
    - Now all data is in the database and we have an online multi-user system!
