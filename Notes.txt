Bug: 

First get publish git branch working. Figure out how to add remote repository.

Deployment: Try Azure. Setup account, install Azure App Service, do tutorial at:
https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/app-service-extension/getting-started




Now we have a basic client/server framework with CRUD and user logon with token and server stores hashed passwords.
Next:
    - Put framwork into git, learn how to use it.
    - Using framework, setup deployment, with dev, staging, and production. Test.
    - Announce on node meetup that I have a node/express/sequelize framework w tokens, hashed pwds.

One step at a time add framwork to prototype and refactor prototype:
    - Put the entire prototype into the public folder. It replaces index.html. Make that index2.html.
    - Get logon working. This is the first big step. The rest will be easy but take time.
    - Admin page, add three sections for countries, orgs, users.
    - Get countries working.
    - Get orgs working.
    - Get users working, with lots of validation.
    - Refactor how three TrsDatabase tables are done into dataModel and viewModel.
    - Put these three tables into the database.
    - Redo the local storage articles table, put into database.
    - Now all data is in the database and we have an online multi-user system!

----- Setup node this way:
> npm init -y   Uses all default in the package.json. Then edit it.
> npm install nodemon --save-dev
> npm install express --save
> npm install body-parser --save
> npm install sequelize --save
> npm install mysql2 --save
    "main": "./work/server.js",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "node ./work/server.js",
        "dev":   "nodemon ./work/server.js"
    },
For server auth class:
> npm install jsonwebtoken --save
> npm install bcryptjs --save
